## Description

This application uses commmand line input, Node, and .Inquirer to create a software engineering team profile. Jest is also used to test and ensure the code passes.

Users are prompted by the application to provide information regarding team members. Users will provide the team member's name, role, id, email, and/or office number, GitHub username, or school. Users will then be asked if another member will be added. Once all members have been added an HTML file will be generated with the information provided.
